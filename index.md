# Cara Netzer

Growing up, I was always most passionate about both math and history. Math came naturally to me and I loved how satisfying it was to solve a problem. In college, this translated into computer science and sociology; technical writing and problem solving was rewarding, but my focus ended up switching to sociology as I found it combined more of my passions. Post-grad, I began my career working in a public defender office to bolster avenues that add a social work lens to criminal defense teams. In that role I worked a lot with our agency's website and was reminded of all the things I loved about computer science in college. I now want to move into the tech field in order to come up with creative solutions to social problems, to bring people joy, and to make the world more accessible for more of us.
